# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Ansible applies security fixes according to the 3-versions-back support
policy. Please find more information in [our docs](
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/reference_appendices/release_and_maintenance.html#release-status
).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please check out [our bug reporting docs](
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/reporting_bugs_and_features.html#reporting-a-bug
) if you want to report a security-related problem with Ansible.

Should you be tempted to disclose a vulnerability, please consider
following responsible disclosure practices and drop a line to
security@ansible.com so that we'd have a chance to patch it before it
goes public. Thanks in advance!
