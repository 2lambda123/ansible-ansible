bugfixes:
- basic - Make Ansiballz pass the module name explicitly to basic for
  an intermediate module name until arguments can be parsed. This should
  be correct in almost all cases, but will fall back to ansible-module-basic
  in the event arguments are not parsed, and the _name attribute is needed.
