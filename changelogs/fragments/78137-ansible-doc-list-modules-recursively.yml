bugfixes:
  - "ansible-doc - when listing modules in collections, proceed recursively. This fixes module listing for community.general 5.x.y and community.network 4.x.y (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/78137)."
  - "ansible-doc - no longer list module and plugin aliases that are created with symlinks (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/78137)."
