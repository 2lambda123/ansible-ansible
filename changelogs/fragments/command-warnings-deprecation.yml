deprecated_features:
  - Starting in 2.13, shell and command modules will no longer warn and suggest modules in lieu of commands. The `warn` parameter to these modules is now deprecated and defaults to `off`. Similarly, the `COMMAND_WARNINGS` configuration option is also deprecated and defaults to False. These will be removed and their presence will become an error in 2.13.
