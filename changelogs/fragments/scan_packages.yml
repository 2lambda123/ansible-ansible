minor_changes:
    - rewrote scan_packages for easier support of  multiple package managers per system
      by default it also tries to use any sysytem that it detects as present.
    - scan_packages now supports Gentoo's portage with portage-utils installed,
      as well as FreeBSD's pkg and Python's pip
