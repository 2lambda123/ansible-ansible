  - >
    ansible-galaxy collection install - fix consistency when installing type ``url`` or ``file``
    requirements by resolving dependencies and determining satisfied requirements from the result.
    Previously, tarfiles were were always reinstalled if the dependency resolver ran, and could
    be short-circuited if all type ``galaxy`` requirements were satisfied.
    Now ``url`` and ``file`` types are always reinstalled, rather than circumstantially on
    unrelated requirements.
  - ansible-galaxy collection - consolidate message when an invalid version is encountered so it's
    the same regardless of codepath.
bugfixes:
  - >
    ansible-galaxy collection - allow pre-releases without --pre if the pre-release is already installed
    or if the requirement is a pre-release.
  - >
    ansible-galaxy collection - enforce str versions when loading user-requested requirements
    (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78067, https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79109).
  - >
    ansible-galaxy collection - fix installing pre-releases from virtual sources
    (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/79168).
