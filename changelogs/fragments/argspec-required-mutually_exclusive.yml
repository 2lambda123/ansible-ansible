breaking_changes:
- For Python modules, ``required_by`` no longer treats ``none`` as "not specified". It now behaves like all other required checks.
- "For Python modules, the checks for ``required``, ``required_if``, ``required_together``, ``required_one_of``, and ``required_by`` no longer allow an explicitly specified value ``none``.
   The old behavior (explicit ``none`` counts as specified) can be explicitly allowed by setting ``allow_none_value=True`` in the argument spec for that option
   (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69190)."
