breaking_changes:
- For Python modules, ``required_by`` no longer treats ``none`` as "not specified". It now behaves like all other required checks.

minor_changes:
- "For Python modules, the checks for ``required``, ``required_if``, ``required_together``, ``required_one_of``, and ``required_by`` warn when an explicit ``none`` value is passed for them, but still accept that value.
   This behavior will be deprecated in ansible-base 2.12 and disabled in ansible-base 2.16.

   Module authors can explicitly request the old behavior (explicit ``none`` counts as specified) by setting ``allow_none_value=True`` in the argument spec for that option,
   and can explicitly request the new behavior  from ansible-base 2.16 (explicit ``none`` counts as error) by setting ``allow_none_value=False`` in the argument spec for that option
   (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/69190)."
