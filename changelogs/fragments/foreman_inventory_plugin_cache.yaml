bugfixes:
  - foreman inventory plugin - Enable caching via cache plugins by using self.cache instead of
    self._cache. self.cache is a (user-specified) cache plugin when caching is enabled for
    inventory, while self._cache is a dictionary that is unused after being populated since
    it is not stored between uses.
