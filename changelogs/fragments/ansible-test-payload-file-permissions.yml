bugfixes:
  - ansible-test - Use consistent file permissions when delegating tests to a container or remote host.
                   Files with any execute bit set will use permissions ``755``.
                   All other files will use permissions ``644``.
                   (Resolves issue https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/75079)
