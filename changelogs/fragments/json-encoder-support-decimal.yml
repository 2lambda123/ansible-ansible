minor_changes:
  - "``AnsibleJSONEncoder`` now also supports encoding of Decimal values"
  - Without this change you get the error ``Object of type Decimal is not JSON serializable`` when trying to convert a Decimal value to json
  - One example will be when you have an inventory variable in decimal format (eg. ram_gb for a virtual machine) and try to list the inventory with ansible-inventory
