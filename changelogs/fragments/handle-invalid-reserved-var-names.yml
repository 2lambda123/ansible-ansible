  - Expand invalid variable names (invalid identifiers and reserved names) detection to all vars.
  - Add Jinja2 and Ansible reserved names to invalid variable names detection that playbook authors should avoid.

deprecated_features:
  - "Using invalid variable names is deprecated and will be an error in 2.16."
  - "``ansible.vars.reserved.warn_if_reserved`` function is deprecated and will be removed in 2.16. Use functions from ``ansible.vars.reserved`` and/or ``ansible.vars.validation`` to replace its functionality."
