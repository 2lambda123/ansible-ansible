bugfixes:
  - networking connection plugins - The correct Ansible networking connection helper is now always used.
    Previously, the wrong script could be used, depending on the value of the ``PATH`` environment variable.
    As a result, users were sometimes required to set ``ANSIBLE_CONNECTION_PATH`` to use the correct script.
deprecated_features:
  - networking connection plugins - The ``ANSIBLE_CONNECTION_PATH`` config option no longer has any effect, and will be removed in a future release.
breaking_changes:
  - networking connection plugins - The ``ANSIBLE_CONNECTION_PATH`` config option no longer has any effect.
