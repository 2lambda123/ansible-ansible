minor_changes:
  - Cache host_group_vars after instantiating it once since it is stateless. Also limit the amount of repetitive work it needs to do every time it runs.
  - Call PluginLoader.all() once for vars plugins, and load vars plugins that run automatically or are enabled specifically after that.
