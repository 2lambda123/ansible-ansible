breaking_changes:
  - NetBSD virtualization facts (specifically `ansible_virtualization_type`) now returns a more accurate value by checking the value of the `machdep.hypervisor` `sysctl` key. This change is breaking because in some cases previously, we would erroneously report `xen` even when the target is not running on Xen. This prevents that behavior in most cases.
