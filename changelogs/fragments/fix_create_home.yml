     user - The user module created the home directory itself when the parent
     directory of the home directory was missing. This causes the following
     execution of ``luseradd`` in case that local is set to yes to fail.
     Now always create the home directory on our own and don't ask ``luseradd``
     or ``useradd`` to do this for us.
