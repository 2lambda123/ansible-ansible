breaking_changes:
  - As a result of refactoring of ``ansible.executor.play_iterator.PlayIterator``, the following have been removed from the codebase ``ansible.executor.play_iterator.FailedStates``, ``ansible.executor.play_iterator.HostState.fail_state`` and ``ansible.executor.play_iterator.PlayIterator.set_fail_state_for_host` as they are no longer used internally. Instead there is ``ansible.executor.play_iterator.HostState.failed`` instance boolean variable. Methods ``ansible.executor.play_iterator.get_failed_hosts`` and ``ansible.executor.play_iterator.is_failed`` are not affected by this change.
