  Stopped wrapping all commands sent over SSH on a Windows target with a
  ``powershell.exe`` executable. This results in one less process being started
  on each command for Windows to improve efficiency, simplify the code, and
  make ``raw`` an actual raw command run with the default shell configured on
  the Windows sshd settings. This should have no affect on most tasks except
  for ``raw`` which now is not guaranteed to always be running in a PowerShell
  shell and from having the console output codepage set to UTF-8. To avoid this
  issue either swap to using ``ansible.windows.win_command``,
  ``ansible.windows.win_shell``, ``ansible.windows.win_powershell`` or manually
  wrap the raw command with the shell commands needed to set the output console
  encoding.
