  winrm/psrp - fix using extra variables with fully qualified connection names
  (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78566).
deprecated_features:
- >-
  Determining extra vars for connection plugins using the plugin name is deprecated.
  Instead of setting the class attribute allow_extras to True, set allow_extras
  to a list of tuple pairs.
  The first item in each pair is a regex to match variable names, and the second
  item is the replacement string.
  For example, to match all variable names starting with ``prefix_`` and remove the
  the prefix, set allow_extras to ``[(r'^prefix_', '')]``.
  To keep the prefix, allow_extras can be set to ``[(r'(^prefix_)', r'\1')]``.
