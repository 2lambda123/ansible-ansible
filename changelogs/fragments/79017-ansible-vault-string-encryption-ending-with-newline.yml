bugfixes:
  - >-
    ansible-vault encrypt_string - started appending a line feed at the end of the encrypted string output. It was missing,
    which cased problems identifying where this string ends in some some shells (like bash) or accidentally copying an
    extra trailing terminator symbol (e.g., zsh adds prints out a ``%`` sign to signal where the original output stops)
    (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/issues/78932).
