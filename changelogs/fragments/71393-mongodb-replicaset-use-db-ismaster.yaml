bugfixes:
  - Fixes (https://github.com/ansible-collections/community.mongodb/issues/136).
    Previously the module queried the local.system.replset collection to
    determine the replicaset name. This required authentication if it was
    enabled. The module now uses the db.isMaster command to determine this
    and this does not require authentication. The module previously only
    authenticated when login details were provided and authentication was
    enabled. The module will now always authenticate if login details
    are provided.
