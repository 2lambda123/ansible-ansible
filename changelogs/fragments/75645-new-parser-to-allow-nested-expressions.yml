minor_changes:
  - inventory - added new class 'PyparsingPatternParser' to allow nested pattern expressions when selecting hosts by using the pyparsing library.
    Applies to lookup plugins, within 'hosts:' in playbooks and when using --limit.
  - inventory - added class 'AnsiblePatternParser' and moved all functions that are specifically used for parsing patterns the 'ansible way'.
    Used in case the pyparsing library cannot be imported, or if python version is below 2.8 (noted as variable HAS_PYPARSING).
  - inventory - added attribute self._parser to InventoryManager to change between the two beforementioned parsers,
    if dependencies can be installed.
    (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/75645)

known_issues:
  - does not parse patterns in the order they are written (which is how it was parsed before) but due to the use of infix notation
    it is parsed in this order - NAND > NOT > AND > OR.
    Either change order by using parentheses or PyparsingPatternParser has to be modified to ignore infix notation.
