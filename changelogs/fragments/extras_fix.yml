bugfixes:
  - connection plugins using the 'extras' option feature would need variables to match the plugin's loaded name,
    sometimes requiring fqcn, which is not the same as the documented/declared/expected variables.
    Now we fall back to the 'basename' of the fqcn, but plugin authors can still set the expected value directly.
