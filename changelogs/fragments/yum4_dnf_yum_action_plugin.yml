major_changes:
  - yum and dnf modules now at feature parity
  - YUM4 Compatibility In the past, there was only yum which is now known as
    yum3 or yum 3.x but now there is a "new yum" known as yum4 or yum 4.x which
    is actually just a yum command-line compatibility layer on top of dnf and
    since the Ansible modules for yum(aka yum3) and dnf(aka yum4) call each of
    yum3 and yum4 python APIs natively on the backend, the Ansible now features
    a yum action plugin that will hand off to the correct package manager
    backend Ansible module
  - New yumdnf module that defines the shared argument specification for both
    yum and dnf modules and provides an entry point to share code when
    applicable

minor_changes:
  - Fixed group actions in check mode to report correct changed state
  - Better error handling for depsolve and transaction errors in DNF
  - Fixed group action idempotent transactions in dnf backend
  - Add use_backend to yum module/action plugin
  - Fix dnf handling of autoremove to be compatible with yum
  - Enable installroot tests for yum4(dnf) integration testing, dnf
    backend now supports that
  - Switch from zip to bc for certain package install/remove test
    cases in yum integration tests. The dnf depsolver downgrades
    python when you uninstall zip which alters the test environment
    and we have no control over that.
