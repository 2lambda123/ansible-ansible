    Plugins in collections can now be marked as private by adding ``private: true`` to their routing information in ``meta/runtime.yml``.
    This will prevent them being listed by ``ansible-doc --list``. The JSON output of the documentation will contain ``"private": true``
    (https://github.com/ansible/ansible/pull/79370).
