    This bullet item includes a paragraph and a nested list,
    which works because the content of the YAML list item
    is an escaped string block with reStructuredText formatting.

    * list item 1
    * list item 2

    .. code-block:: text

      This example is also rendered
      correctly on multiple lines
      as a pre-formatted block.

  - Network

    * Created new connection plugins ``network_cli`` and ``netconf`` to replace ``connection=local`` (which will continue to work).
    * No more ``unable to open shell``. A clear and descriptive message will be displayed in ansible-playbook normal output without needing to enable debug mode
    * Loads of documentation. FIXME LINK
