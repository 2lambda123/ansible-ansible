bugfixes:
  - ansible-test - The ``pylint`` sanity test now includes the controller/target context of files when grouping them.
    This allows the ``--py-version`` option to be passed to ``pylint`` to indicate the minimum supported Python version
    for each test context, preventing ``pylint`` from defaulting to the Python version used to invoke the test.
