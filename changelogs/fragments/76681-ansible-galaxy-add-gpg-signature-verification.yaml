minor_changes:
- >-
  ``ansible-galaxy collection [install|verify]`` - use gpg to verify the authenticity of
  the signed MANIFEST.json with ASCII armored detached signatures provided by the Galaxy
  server. The keyring used by default is ~/.ansible/pubring.kbx and is not managed by
  ``ansible-galaxy``.
- >-
  ``ansible-galaxy collection [install|verify]``` - allow user-provided signature sources
  in addition to those from the Galaxy server.
  Each collection entry in a requirements file can specify a "signatures" key followed by
  a list of sources.
  Collection name(s) provided on the CLI can specify additional signature sources by using
  the "--signatures" CLI option.
  Signature sources should be URIs that can be opened with urllib.request.urlopen(), such as
  "https://example.com/path/to/detached_signature.asc" or "file:///path/to/detached_signature.asc".
- >-
  ``ansible-galaxy collection install`` - Store Galaxy server metadata alongside installed
  collections for provenance. Signatures obtained from the Galaxy server can be used for offline
  verification with ``ansible-galaxy collection verify --offline``.
- ansible-galaxy collection install - Add a global toggle to turn off GPG signature verification.
