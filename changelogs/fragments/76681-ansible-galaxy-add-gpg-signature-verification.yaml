minor_changes:
- >-
  ``ansible-galaxy collection [install|verify]`` - use gpg to verify the authenticity of
  the signed ``MANIFEST.json`` with ASCII armored detached signatures provided by the Galaxy
  server. The keyring (which is not managed by ``ansible-galaxy``) must be provided with
  the ``--keyring`` option to use signature verification.
  If no ``--keyring`` is specified and the collection to ``install|verify`` has associated
  detached signatures on the Galaxy server, a warning is provided.
- >-
  ``ansible-galaxy collection [install|verify]`` - allow user-provided signature sources
  in addition to those from the Galaxy server.
  Each collection entry in a requirements file can specify a ``signatures`` key followed by
  a list of sources.
  Collection name(s) provided on the CLI can specify additional signature sources by using
  the ``--signatures`` CLI option.
  Signature sources should be URIs that can be opened with ``urllib.request.urlopen()``, such as
  "https://example.com/path/to/detached_signature.asc" or "file:///path/to/detached_signature.asc".
  The ``--keyring`` option must be specified if signature sources are provided.
- >-
  ``ansible-galaxy collection install`` - Store Galaxy server metadata alongside installed
  collections for provenance. Signatures obtained from the Galaxy server can be used for offline
  verification with ``ansible-galaxy collection verify --offline``.
- >-
  ``ansible-galaxy collection install`` - Add a global toggle to turn off GPG signature verification.
- >-
  ``ansible-galaxy collection install`` - Add a global configuration to modify the required number of
  signatures that must verify the authenticity of the collection. By default, the number of required
  successful signatures is 1.
  Set this option to -1 to require all signatures verify the collection.
- >-
  ``ansible-galaxy collection install`` - Add a global ignore list for gpg signature errors.
  This can be used to ignore certain signatures when the number of required successful signatures is -1 (all).
  When the required number of successful signatures is a positive integer, the only effect this has is to
  display fewer errors to the user on failure (success is determined by having the minimum number of
  successful signatures, in which case all errors are disregarded).
