# Below is the original way of defining hosts and groups.

- jupiter
- host: saturn
  vars:
    moon: titan
    moon2: enceladus

- host: mars

- host: zeus
  vars:
  - ansible_ssh_port: 3001

- group: greek
  hosts:
  - zeus
  - hera
  - poseidon
  vars:
  - ansible_ssh_port: 3000
  - ntp_server: olympus.example.com

- group: norse
  hosts:
  - host: thor
    vars:
    - hammer: True
  - odin
  - loki

- group: ruler

# Here we demonstrate that groups can be defined on a per-host basis.
# When managing a large set of systems this format makes it easier to
# ensure each of the systems is defined in a set of groups, compared
# to the standard group definitions, where a host may need to be added
# to multiple disconnected groups.
