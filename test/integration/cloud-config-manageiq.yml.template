# This is the configuration template for ansible-test ManageIQ integration tests.
#
# You do not need this template if you are:
#
# 1) Running integration tests without using ansible-test.
# 2) Using the automatically provisioned manageiq docker container in ansible-test.
#
# If you do not want to use the automatically provided ManageIQ,
# fill in the @VAR placeholders below and save this file without the .template extension.
# This will cause ansible-test to use the given configuration and not launch the container.
#
# It is recommended that you DO NOT use this template unless you cannot use the container.
example: test
