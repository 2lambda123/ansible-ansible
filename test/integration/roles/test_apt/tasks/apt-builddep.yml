# test installing build-deps using netcat and quilt as test victims.

# Deps can be discovered like so (taken from ubuntu 12.04)
# ====
# root@localhost:~ # apt-rdepends --build-depends --follow=DEPENDS netcat
# Reading package lists... Done
# Building dependency tree
# Reading state information... Done
# netcat

# ====
# Since many things depend on debhelper, let's just uninstall quilt, then
# install build-dep for netcat to get it back.  build-dep doesn't have an
# uninstall, so we don't need to test for reverse actions (eg, uninstall
# build-dep and ensure things are clean)
