# This is the configuration template for ansible-test Vultr integration tests.
#
# You do not need this template if you are:
#
# 1) Running integration tests without using ansible-test.
# 2) Using the automatically provisioned Vultr credentials in ansible-test.
#
# If you want to test against the Vultr public API,
# fill in the values below and save this file without the .template extension.
# This will cause ansible-test to use the given configuration.
