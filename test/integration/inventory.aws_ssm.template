# This is the configuration template for ansible-test windows-integration tests.
# It can also be used with the legacy `make` based method of running tests.
#
# You do not need this template if you are:
#
# 1) Using the `--windows` option to provision temporary Windows instances on EC2.
#
# If you do not want to use the automatically provisioned temporary Windows instances,
# fill in the @VAR placeholders below and save this file without the .template extension.
#
# NOTE: Automatic provisioning of Windows instances on EC2 requires an ansible-core-ci API key.
#
# REMINDER: Standard ports for winrm are 5985 (HTTP) and 5986 (HTTPS).
