# Preconditions to run this tests:
# 1. Create a TLS certificate on AWS ACM (Amazon Certificate Manager), Console link: https://console.aws.amazon.com/acm/home
# 2. Set the domain name in ../defaults/main.yml to the one of your certificate
# 3. Set the ARN in ../defaults/main.yml to the one of your certificate

# NOTE: This could also be done by a Ansible ACM module in the future,
# but for now we don't have one.
