This is a test of various filter plugins found in Ansible (ex: core.py), and 
not so much a test of the core filters in Jinja2.

Dumping the same structure to YAML

- this is a list element
-   this: is a hash element in a list
    warp: 9
    where: endor


Dumping the same structure to JSON, but don't pretty print

["this is a list element", {"this": "is a hash element in a list", "warp": 9, "where": "endor"}]

Dumping the same structure to YAML, but don't pretty print

- this is a list element
- {this: is a hash element in a list, warp: 9, where: endor}


From a recorded task, the changed, failed, success, and skipped
tests are shortcuts to ask if those tasks produced changes, failed,
succeeded, or skipped (as one might guess).

Changed = True
Failed  = False
Success = True
Skipped = False

The mandatory filter fails if a variable is not defined and returns the value.
To avoid breaking this test, this variable is already defined.

a = 1

There are various casts available

int = 1

y_bool = True
yes_bool = True
on_bool = True
str_1_bool = True
int_1_bool = True
float_1_bool = True
full_true_bool = True
t_bool = True

n_bool = False
no_bool = False
off_bool = False
str_0_bool = False
int_0_bool = False
float_0_bool = False
full_false_bool = False
f_bool = False

String quoting

quoted = quoted

The fileglob module returns the list of things matching a pattern.

fileglob = []

There are also various string operations that work on paths.  These do not require
files to exist and are passthrus to the python os.path functions

/etc/motd with basename = motd
/etc/motd with dirname  = /etc

TODO: realpath follows symlinks.  There isn't a test for this just now.

TODO: add tests for set theory operations like union

regex_replace = bar
regex_search = 0001
regex_findall = "['car', 'tar', 'bar']"
regex_escape = \^f\.\*o\(\.\*\)\$
