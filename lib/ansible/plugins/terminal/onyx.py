  - This onyx terminal plugin provides low level abstraction APIs and options for
    setting the remote host terminal after initial login.

options:
  terminal_stdout_re:

    description:
      - A single regex pattern or a sequence of patterns along with optional flags
        to match the command prompt from the received response chunk. This option
        accepts C(pattern) and C(flags) keys. The value of C(pattern) is a python
        regex pattern to match the response and the value of C(flags) is the value
        accepted by I(flags) argument of I(re.compile) python method to control
        the way regex is matched with the response, for example I('re.I').

      - The answer to reply with if the C(terminal_initial_prompt) is matched. The value can be a single answer
        or a list of answers for multiple terminal_initial_prompt. In case the login menu has
        multiple prompts the sequence of the prompt and excepted answer should be in same order and the value
        of I(terminal_prompt_checkall) should be set to I(True) if all the values in C(terminal_initial_prompt) are
        expected to be matched and set to I(False) if any one login prompt is to be matched.

        option is matched it won't check for other prompts. When set to I(True) it will check for all the prompts
        mentioned in C(terminal_initial_prompt) option in the given order and all the prompts
