      - A single regex pattern or a sequence of patterns along with optional flags
        to match the command prompt from the received response chunk. This option
        accepts C(pattern) and C(flags) keys. The value of C(pattern) is a python
        regex pattern to match the response and the value of C(flags) is the value
        accepted by I(flags) argument of I(re.compile) python method to control
        the way regex is matched with the response, for example I('re.I').

        or a list of answers for multiple terminal_initial_prompt. In case the login menu has
        multiple prompts the sequence of the prompt and excepted answer should be in same order and the value
        of I(terminal_prompt_checkall) should be set to I(True) if all the values in C(terminal_initial_prompt) are
        expected to be matched and set to I(False) if any one login prompt is to be matched.
