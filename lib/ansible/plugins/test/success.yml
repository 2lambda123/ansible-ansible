  aliases: [succeeded, successful]
  description:
    - Tests if task finished successfully, opposite of P(ansible.builtin.failed#test).
    - This test checks for the existence of a C(failed) key in the input dictionary and that it is V(False) if present.
    - Tasks that get skipped or not executed due to other failures (syntax, templating, unreachable host, etc) do not return a 'failed' status.
    - To test if a successful task executed an action, see P(ansible.builtin.skippeded#test) and P(ansible.builtin.unreachable#test).
