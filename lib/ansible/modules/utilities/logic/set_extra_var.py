module: set_extra_var
short_description: Sets an extra variable from a playbook.
description:
    - This module allows setting new variables.  Variables are set on a global basis
    - These variables will survive between plays during an Ansible run, even for different host groups
    - The C(set_extra_var) module takes name=var_name value=var_value pairs as variables to set
      in the playbook scope. Or alternatively, accepts complex arguments
      using the C(args:) statement.
'''

EXAMPLES = '''
# Example setting host facts using key=value pairs
- set_extra_var: name="my_var" value="my_value"
# Example setting host facts using other variables
- set_fact:
    name: my_var
    value: "{{ local_var * 2 }}"

# Example inventory :
    group_all = { host_1, host_2, host_3 }
    group_one = { host_1 }
    group_two = { host_2, host3 }

# Example playbook
---
- hosts: group_one
    tasks:
        - name: list /tmp
            shell: ls /tmp
            register: out
    - name: set global variable
        setglobal: name=myvar value="{{out}}"
- hosts: group_two
    tasks:
        - debug: msg="{{myvar}}"
# Example command
