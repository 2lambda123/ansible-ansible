module: win_unzip
version_added: "2.0"
short_description: Unzips compressed files and archives on the Windows node
description:
- Unzips compressed files and archives.
- Supports .zip files natively
- Supports other formats supported by the Powershell Community Extensions (PSCX) module (basically everything 7zip supports)
requires:
- PSCX
options:
  src:
    description:
      - File to be unzipped (provide absolute path)
    required: true
  dest:
    description:
      - Destination of zip file (provide absolute path of directory). If it does not exist, the directory will be created.
    required: true
  rm:
    description:
      - Remove the zip file, after unzipping
    required: no
    choices:
      - true
      - false
      - yes
      - no
    default: false
  recurse:
    description:
      - Recursively expand zipped files within the src file.
    required: no
    default: false
    choices:
      - true
      - false
      - yes
      - no
  creates:
    description:
      - If this file or directory exists the specified src will not be extracted.
    required: no
    default: null
notes:
- For extracting any compression types other than .zip, the PowerShellCommunityExtensions (PSCX) Module is required.  This module (in conjunction with PSCX) has the ability to recursively unzip files within the src zip file provided and also functionality for many other compression types. If the destination directory does not exist, it will be created before unzipping the file.  Specifying rm parameter will force removal of the src file after extraction.
