short_description: Manages certificates on a Windows machine
description:
  - The M(win_certificate) module can be used to import or remove certificates from the internal LocalMachine certificate store. 
    The certificate needs to be copied to the node before you try to import/delte the certificate object, as the module needs to extract
    certificate facts from the cert file
    The following filetypes are supported *.pfx, *.p12, *.cer, *.crt, *.p7b, *.spc
    If you want to import a certificate with private key included (PFX), you have to provide the certificate password.
