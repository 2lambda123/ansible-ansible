module: win_disk_management
version_added: '2.4'
short_description: A Windows disk management module
description:
   - With the module you can select a disk on the computer and manage it (e.g. initializing, partitioning, formatting).
   - To select the disk and to manage it you have several options which are all described in the documentation.
   - If more than one disk with the exact same specifications was found on the computer, the first found disk will be selected.
   - The module detects any existing volume and/or partition on the selected disk and will end the module in this case.
   - If parameter file_system is set to "refs" the parameter allocation_unit_size will be automatically adjusted to "64" (KB).
   - The module recognizes whether the selected switches are suitable with the selected parameters.
   - If they do not fit with the selected parameters, the switches will be automatically deactivated.
   - The modul will set the disk to online and writeable (read-only eq. false) if it's not the state of the disk already.
   - If the disk was initilaized already the modul will try to convert the partition style of the disk to the selected partition style.
   - The module will stop and start the service "ShellHWService" again in order to avoid disk management GUI messages.
