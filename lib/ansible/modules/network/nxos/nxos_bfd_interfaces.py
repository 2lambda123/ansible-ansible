  running_config:
    description:
      - The module, by default, will connect to the remote device and
        retrieve the current running-config to use as a base for comparing
        against the contents of source. There are times when it is not
        desirable to have the task get the current running-config for
        every task in a playbook.  The I(running_config) argument allows the
        implementer to pass in the configuration to use as the base
        config for comparison. This value of this option should be the
        output received from device by executing command
        C(show running-config | section '^interface|^feature bfd')
    version_added: "2.10"
  state:
    description:
      - The state of the configuration after module completion. 
      - The states I(rendered), I(gathered) and I(parsed) does not perform any
        change on the device. 
      - The state I(rendered) will transform the configuration in C(config) option to platform
        specific CLI commands which will be returned in the I(rendered) key within the result.
        For state I(rendered) active connection to remote host is not required.
      - The state I(gathered) will fetch the running configuration from device and transform
        it into structured data in the format as per the resource module argspec and the
        value is returned in the I(gathered) key within the result.
      - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and transforms
        it into JSON format as per the resource module parameters and the value is returned in
        the I(parsed) key within the result. The value of C(running_config) option should be the
        same format as the output of command I(show running-config | section '^interface|^feature bfd')
        executed on device. For state I(parsed) active connection to remote host is not required.
