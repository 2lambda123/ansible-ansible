Context of the running Ansible.

In the future we *may* create Context objects to allow running multiple Ansible plays in parallel
with different contexts but that is currently out of scope as the Ansible library is just for
running the ansible command line tools.

These APIs are still in flux so do not use them unless you are willing to update them with every Ansible release

    if they were run with different command line args or from different current working directories)
    to exist in the same process.  But at the moment, we don't need that so this code has not been
