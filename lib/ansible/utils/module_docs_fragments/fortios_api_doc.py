notes:
  - Due to the volume of available options, it is unreasonable to list all the possible configuration options for each module.
    Instead, run the module with "print_current_config = true" to get full list of possible options output as a json file at
    the path where the playbook is executed. Additionally, default objects and argument specifications (including options,
    suboptions, and expected values) are saved locally wherever the playbook is executed.
  - Module is written to take input of a desired end config of the device. As such, if an object in the configuration
    is missing from that file, it will be DELETED from the device. It is recommended to use I(print_current_config: true)
    for onboarding devices with existing configuration.
  - The module determines whether an existing configuration matches the proposed configuration by checking each key - value
    pair in the proposal against the existing configuration. Any keys not found in the proposed configuration are assumed
    to be in their desired state, because the list of keys is exhaustive and the API always returns all keys.
