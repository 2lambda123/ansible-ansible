Before diving into the really fun parts--playbooks, configuration management, deployment, and orchestration--you must first learn how to get Ansible installed and review some basic concepts.  It is also important to review how to execute ad-hoc commands in parallel across your nodes using ``/usr/bin/ansible``.  Additionally, you should also review the various types of modules available in Ansible (for those looking to write their own modules, refer to the :doc:`Developing Modules <developing_modules>` section of the |ad|).
