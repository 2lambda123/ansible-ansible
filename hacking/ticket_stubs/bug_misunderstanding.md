Hi!

Thanks very much for your submission to Ansible.  It sincerely means a lot to us.

We believe the ticket you have filed is being somewhat misunderstood, as one thing works a little differently than stated.

In particular, we believe you have said:

   * THING ONE

However, however what is happening is that:

   * THING TWO

We would suggest:

   * THING THREE

In the future, this might be a topic better suited for the user list or chat channels.

Because this project is very active, we're unlikely to see comments made on closed tickets and we lock them after some time.
The mailing list and irc are great ways to ask questions, or post if you don't think this particular issue is resolved.

See  this page for a complete and up to date list of communication channels and their purposes:

Thank you once again for this and your interest in Ansible!
