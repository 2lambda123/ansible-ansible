    "Pauses playbook execution for a set amount of time, or until a prompt is acknowledged. All parameters are optional. The default behavior is to pause with a prompt.", 
    "You can use C(ctrl+c) if you wish to advance a pause earlier than it is set to expire or if you need to abort a playbook run entirely. To continue early: press C(ctrl+c) and then C(c). To abort a playbook: press C(ctrl+c) and then C(a).", 
    "The pause module integrates into async/parallelized playbooks without any special considerations (see also: Rolling Updates). When using pauses with the C(serial) playbook parameter (as in rolling updates) you are only prompted once for the current group of hosts."
