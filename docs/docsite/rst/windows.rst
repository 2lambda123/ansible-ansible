Windows Guides
``````````````

This section is new and evolving. The idea here is to expand on the lone
Windows page in greater depth and provide more information around managing
Windows hosts with Ansible.

As Windows is a non-POSIX-compliant OS there are various differences between
how Ansible interacts with them and the way Windows works. These guides are
here to try and highlight the differences between Linux/Unix hosts and ones
running Windows.
