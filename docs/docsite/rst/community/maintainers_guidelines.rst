Maintainer responsibilities
===========================

When you contribute a module to a collection included in the ``ansible`` package, you become a maintainer for that module once it has been merged. Maintainership empowers you with the authority to accept, reject, or request revisions to pull requests on your module -- but as they say, "with great power comes great responsibility."

Maintainers of Ansible collections are expected to provide feedback, responses, or actions on pull requests or issues to the collection(s) they maintain in a reasonably timely manner. You can also update the contributor guidelines for that collection, in collaboration with the Ansible community team and the other maintainers of that collection.

In particular, collection maintainers:

- keep README, development guidelines, and other general collection :ref:`documentation<Documentation>` relevant,
- :ref:`review<Reviewing>` and :ref:`commit<Committing>` changes made by other contributors,
- :ref:`backport<Backporting>` changes to stable branches,
- address issues discovered to appropriate contributors,
- :ref:`release<Releasing>` collections,
- watch that collections adhere the `Collection Requirements <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/blob/main/collection_requirements.rst>`_,
- keep tracking changes announced in ``Changes impacting collection contributors and maintainers`` `GitHub issue <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/issues/45>`_ and timely update a collection in accordance with them,
- increase a number of active contributors and maintainers by :ref:`building healthy community<Expanding community>` around collections,
- revise this document regularly for updates and sharing their experience through changing it.


Who is a collection maintainer
==============================

A collection maintainer is a contributor trusted by the community who makes significant and regular contributions to the project and showed themselves as a specialist in the related area.

Collection maintainers have :ref:`extended permissions<Collection maintainers>` in the collection scope.

Collection maintainers satisfy the :ref:`requirements<Requirements for maintainers>`.

.. _Requirements for maintainers:

Requirements for maintainers
----------------------------

Maintainers act in accordance with `Ansible Code of Conduct <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html>`_.

Maintainers (including candidates) have:

- History of multiple contributions to a collection.
- Excellent technical judgement in collection-related areas.
- Responsiveness to mentions in issues and pull requests.
- Responsiveness to issues and pull requests assigned to them.
- Read these guidelines and the linked documents.
- Subscribed to:

  + the collection repository they maintain (the ``Watch`` button â†’ ``All activity``),
  + the `"Changes impacting collection contributors and maintainers" GitHub issue <https://github.com/ansible-collections/overview/issues/45>`_,
  + the `Bullhorn newsletter <https://github.com/ansible/community/wiki/News#the-bullhorn>`_.
- Knowledge and intention to manage a collection performing the tasks listed in these guidelines. Maintainers can divide responsibilities between each other.

How to become a maintainer
--------------------------

A person who is interested in becoming a maintainer and satisfies the :ref:`requirements<Requirements for maintainers>` may either self-nominate or be nominated by another maintainer.

To nominate a candidate, please create a GitHub issue in the relevant collection repository. If there is no response, the repository is not actively maintained, or the current maintainers do not have permissions to add the candidate, please create the issue under `ansible/community <https://github.com/ansible/community>`_ repository.

Communication channels
=======================

 Maintainers must subscribe to the `"Changes impacting collection contributors and maintainers" GitHub repo <https://github.com/ansible-collections/news-for-maintainers>`_ and should subscribe to the `Bullhorn newsletter <https://github.com/ansible/community/wiki/News#the-bullhorn>`_.


Collection contributors and maintainers should also communicate through:

* Chat channels such as ``#ansible-community``, ``#ansible-devel``
* Mailing lists such as `ansible-announce <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/ansible-announce>`_ and `ansible-devel <https://groups.google.com/d/forum/ansible-devel>`_
* Collection pinboards, issues, and GitHub discussions in corresponding repositories
* quarterly Contributor Summits
* Ansible fests and local meetups

See :ref:`communication` for more details on these communication channels.

Contributor Summits
-------------------

Because our project is a community of individuals collaborating on making the world better through developing automation software, the social aspect is vital for the project's prosperity as for any community.

The quarterly Ansible Contributor Summit is a global event that provides our contributors a great opportunity to meet each other, communicate, share ideas, and see that there are other real persons behind the messages on IRC or GitHub. In other words, it gives a sense of community.

To make the community more robust, keep tracking the `Bullhorn newsletter <https://github.com/ansible/community/wiki/News#the-bullhorn>`_ for information when the next contributor summit will happen, invite contributors you know, and take part in the event together.

Weekly community chat meetings
-----------------------------

The important project-scale decisions are made by the community and the Steering Committee at weekly IRC meetings in the ``#ansible-community`` IRC channel. See the `meeting schedule <https://github.com/ansible/community/blob/main/meetings/README.md#schedule>`_.

If you want to see what is on the agenda, refer to the issues in the `community-topics repository <https://github.com/ansible-community/community-topics>`_. If you want to submit a topic, create an issue in the repository.

.. _Expanding community:

Expanding community
===================

.. note::

  If you discover good ways how to expand a community or make it more robust, please share them with other maintainers through changing this document.


Increasing a number of active contributors and maintainers
----------------------------------------------------------

Maintainers are interested in increasing a number of active long-term contributors for a collection they maintain.

Put a note in your ``README`` that the project is actively accepting new contributors.

Contributors are reviewers, issue or pull request authors, testers, maintainers, and all other people who help develop the project.

Every regular contributor was once a newcomer. Make the first experience as positive as possible to encourage the new people coming back.

Good development documentation makes contributors life much easier. Get feedback from new contributors if there were things they struggled with when working on their proposals and improve the documentation correspondingly.

Create the ``CONTRIBUTING`` file in your repository. In there, add a link to the `Quick-start guide <create_pr_quick_start_guide.rst>`_ as well as to other guidelines describing things specific to your collection.

Make contributors feel welcome. Greet and thank contributors impersonally in ``README`` and individually in their proposals.
Thank all participants after merging or closing a proposal.

Be responsive. Respond as quickly as possible. Even if you cannot review a proposal right now, greet and thank the author.

If your collection is not huge, add and keep updated the ``CONTRIBUTORS`` file listing all the contributors including issue reporters and refer to it from your ``README``. You can ask contributors to do it themselves or add a note about this to the development documentation of the collection.

Do not fix trivial non-critical bugs yourself. Instead, mentor a person who would like to contribute.
Mark issues with labels like ``easyfix``, ``waiting_on_contributor``, and ``docs``.
They will let newcomers know where they can find easy wins.

When reviewing an issue, if applicable, ask the author whether they want to fix the issue themselves providing the link to the `Quick-start guide <create_pr_quick_start_guide.rst>`_.

Conduct pull request days regularly. You could plan PR days, for example, in the last Friday of every month when you and other maintainers go through all open issues and pull requests focusing on old ones, asking people if you can help, and so on. If there are pull requests that look abandoned (for example, there is no response on your help offers since the previous PR day), announce that anyone else interested can complete the pull request.

Adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards behavior violating `Ansible Code of Conduct <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html>`_. Add information to ``README`` how people can complain referring to the `"Policy violations" Code of Conduct section <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/community/code_of_conduct.html#policy-violations>`_.

Announce that the project needs new contributors and maintainers through available communication channels.

Promote active contributors satisfying :ref:`requirements<Requirements for maintainers>` to maintainers. Revise contributors activity regularly.

If your collection found new maintainers, announce that fact in the `Bullhorn newsletter <https://github.com/ansible/community/wiki/News#the-bullhorn>`_ and during the next Contributor Summit congratulating and thanking them for the work done. You can mention all the people promoted since the previous summit. Remember to invite the other maintainers to the Summit in advance.

Create the ``MAINTAINERS`` file and keep it updated.

Create a pinned issue which announces that the collection needs new maintainers and contributors providing links to the collection's CONTRIBUTING file and other documentation describing how to contribute to and maintain the collection (for example, it could contain a link to these guidelines).

If your collection is a part of Ansible (is shipped with Ansible package), highlight that fact at the top of the collection's README.

.. _Checklist:

Documentation
=============

Maintainers look after the collection documentation.

In particular, they are watching that documents of the collection scope, like ``README.md``, are relevant and timely updated and that modules / plugins documentation adheres the `Ansible documentation format <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/developing_modules_documenting.html>`_ and the `Style guide <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/dev_guide/style_guide/index.html#style-guide>`_.

.. _Reviewing:

Reviewing
=========

Maintainers can accept or reject proposed changes.

Maintainers review code proposals as well as reported issues following the `review checklist <review_checklist.rst>`_ in applicable parts and the recommendations mentioned in the :ref:`Expanding community<Expanding community>` paragraph.

Inclusion in Ansible
====================

If a collection is not included in Ansible (not shipped with Ansible package), maintainers can submit the collection for inclusion by creating a discussion under `ansible-collections/ansible-inclusion repository <https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible-inclusion>`_. For more information, refer to the `repository's README <https://github.com/ansible-collections/ansible-inclusion/blob/main/README.md>`_.

Stepping down
=============

Maintainers should not step down silently. This is especially important when the collection has one or few active maintainer.

If you feel you don't have time to maintain your collection any more or for a long period of time, to prevent negative consequences for the collection and its community:

- Inform other maintainers about it.
- If the collection is under the ``ansible-collections`` organization, also inform the community team in the ``ansible-community`` `Libera.Chat IRC channel <https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/devel/community/communication.html#irc-channels>`_ or by email ``ansible-community@redhat.com``.
- Look at active contributors in the collection to find new maintainers among them. Discuss the potential candidates with other maintainers or with the community team.
- If you failed to find a replacement, create a pinned issue in the collection which announces that the collection needs new maintainers.
- Make the same announcement through the `Bullhorn newsletter <https://github.com/ansible/community/wiki/News#the-bullhorn>`_.
- Please be around to discuss potential candidates found by other maintainers or by the community team.

You can come back at any moment.
