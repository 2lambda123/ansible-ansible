Network Guides

Ansible network collections extend the benefits of simple, powerful, agentless automation to network administrators and teams. Ansible Network modules can configure your network stack, test and validate existing network state, and discover and correct network configuration drift.

If you're new to Ansible, or new to using Ansible for network management, start with :ref:`network_getting_started`. If you are already familiar with network automation with Ansible, see :ref:`network_advanced`.

For documentation on using a particular network collection, see the  :ref:`list_of_collections`. Network collections for various hardware are supported by different teams including the hardware vendors themselves, volunteers from the Ansible community, and the Ansible Network Team.
