Ansible Roadmap
===============

The Ansible team develops a roadmap for each major Ansible release. The latest roadmap shows current work; older roadmaps provide a history of the project.

Based on team and community feedback, an initial roadmap will be published for a major or minor version (ex: 2.0, 2.1).
Subminor versions will generally not have roadmaps published.

The team is aiming for further transparency and better inclusion of both community desires and submissions.

These are the team's *best guess* roadmaps based on the Ansible team's experience and are also based on requests and feedback from the community.
There are things that may not make it due to time constraints, lack of community maintainers, etc.
Each roadmap is published both as an idea of what is upcoming in Ansible, and as a medium for seeking further feedback from the community.

There are multiple places for you to submit feedback:

- Add to the agenda of an IRC `Core Team Meeting <https://github.com/ansible/community/blob/master/meetings/README.md>`_ (preferred)
- Ansible's google-group: ansible-devel
- AnsibleFest conferences
- IRC Freenode channel: #ansible-devel (this one may have things lost in lots of conversation)

See :ref:`Ansible communication channels <communication>` for details on how to speak to us.
