******************************
Ansible Galaxy
******************************

*Ansible Galaxy* refers to the `Galaxy <https://galaxy.ansible.com>`_  website, a free site for finding, downloading, and sharing community developed roles. Downloading roles from Galaxy is
a great way to jumpstart your automation projects.

You can also use the site to share roles that you create. By authenticating with the site using your GitHub account, you're able to *import* roles, making
them available to the Ansible community. Imported roles become available in the Galaxy search index and visible on the site, allowing users to
discover and download them.
