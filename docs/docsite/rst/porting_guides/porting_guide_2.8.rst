Ansible 2.8 Porting Guide
*************************

This section discusses the behavioral changes between Ansible 2.7 and Ansible 2.8.

It is intended to assist in updating your playbooks, plugins and other parts of your Ansible infrastructure so they will work with this version of Ansible.

We suggest you read this page along with `Ansible Changelog for 2.8 <https://github.com/ansible/ansible/blob/devel/changelogs/CHANGELOG-v2.8.rst>`_ to understand what updates you may need to make.

This document is part of a collection on porting. The complete list of porting guides can be found at :ref:`porting guides <porting_guides>`.

Playbook
========

No notable changes.


Command Line
============

Become Prompting
----------------

Beginning in version 2.8, by default Ansible will use the word ``BECOME`` to prompt you for a password for elevated privileges (``sudo`` privileges on unix systems or ``enable`` mode on network devices):

By default in Ansible 2.8::

    ansible-playbook --become --ask-become-pass site.yml
    BECOME password:

If you want the prompt to display the specific ``become_method`` you're using, instead of the agnostic value ``BECOME``, set :ref:`AGNOSTIC_BECOME_PROMPT` to ``False`` in your Ansible configuration.

By default in Ansible 2.7, or with ``AGNOSTIC_BECOME_PROMPT=False`` in Ansible 2.8::

    ansible-playbook --become --ask-become-pass site.yml
    SUDO password:

Modules
=======

Major changes in popular modules are detailed here


Modules removed
---------------

The following modules no longer exist:

* ec2_remote_facts
* azure
* cs_nic
* netscaler
* win_msi

Deprecation notices
-------------------

The following modules will be removed in Ansible 2.12. Please update your playbooks accordingly.

* ``foreman`` use <https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-ansible-modules> instead.
* ``katello`` use <https://github.com/theforeman/foreman-ansible-modules> instead.


Noteworthy module changes
-------------------------

* The ``foreman`` and ``katello`` modules have been deprecated in favor of a set of modules that are broken out per entity with better idempotency in mind.
* The ``foreman`` and ``katello`` modules replacement is officially part of the Foreman Community and supported there.
* The ``tower_credential`` module originally required the ``ssh_key_data`` to be the path to a ssh_key_file.
  In order to work like Tower/AWX, ``ssh_key_data`` now contains the content of the file.
  The previous behavior can be achieved with ``lookup('file', '/path/to/file')``.
* The ``win_scheduled_task`` module deprecated support for specifying a trigger repetition as a list and this format
  will be removed in Ansible 2.12. Instead specify the repetition as a dictionary value.

* The ``win_feature`` module has removed the deprecated ``restart_needed`` return value, use the standardised
  ``reboot_required`` value instead.

* The ``win_package`` module has removed the deprecated ``restart_required`` and ``exit_code`` return value, use the
  standardised ``reboot_required`` and ``rc`` value instead.

* The ``win_get_url`` module has removed the deprecated ``win_get_url`` return dictionary, contained values are
  returned directly.

* The ``win_get_url`` module has removed the deprecated ``skip_certificate_validation`` option, use the standardised
  ``validate_certs`` option instead.
