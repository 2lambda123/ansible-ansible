Extending Ansible: Creating Modules and Plugins for Local Use
***************************************************************

The easiest, quickest, and most popular way to extend Ansible is to write a module or a plugin for local use. You can write and store modules and plugins on your Ansible control node for use within your team or organization. If you want to share a local plugin or module, you can embed it in a role and publish it on Ansible Galaxy. When extending Ansible locally, you can choose any programming language you like, you don't have to clone the main Ansible repo, and you don't have to open a pull request. We do recommend you add tests to your module, but you can ignore that advice with local modules and plugins.
