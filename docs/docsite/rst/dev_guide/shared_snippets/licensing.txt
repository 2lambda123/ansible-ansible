   **LICENSING REQUIREMENTS**
   Ansible enforces the following licensing requirements:
   * Utilities (files in ``lib/ansible/module_utils/``) may have one of two licenses:
      * Any ``module_util`` used only with a few modules for a specific
	    vendor's hardware, provider, or service may be licensed under GPLv3+
	  * All other ``module_utils`` must be licensed under BSD, so third-party and
	    Galaxy modules can use them under a GPL license.
	  * If there's doubt as to which category a ``module_util`` falls into,
        the Ansible Core Team will decide during an Ansible Core Community Meeting.
   * All other files shipped with Ansible (including all modules) must be licensed
     under the GPL license (GPLv3 or later).
