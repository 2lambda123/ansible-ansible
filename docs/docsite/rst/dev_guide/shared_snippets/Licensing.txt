.. note::
   **LICENSING GUIDELINE** - All modules shipped with Ansible must be done so
   under the GPLv3 license. Files under the ``lib/ansible/module_utils/``
   directory should be done so under the BSD license. However, some exceptions
   exist. ``module_utils`` that are for a small set of modules for a specific
   vendor's hardware, provider, or service are allowed to be under GPLv3+
   instead of BSD Licensing. ``module_utils`` that are generic in nature (could
   be used with modules from more than one vendor or project) must be BSD as this
   allows third party and Galaxy modules to utilize the libraries without
   dictating their license.  If there's doubt as to which category a
   ``module_util`` falls into, the Ansible Core Team will decide during an
   Ansible Core Community Meeting.
