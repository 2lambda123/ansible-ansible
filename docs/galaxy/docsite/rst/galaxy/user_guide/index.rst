:dfn:`Ansible Galaxy` refers to the `Galaxy <https://galaxy.ansible.com>`_  website, a free site for finding, downloading, and sharing community developed roles.

Use Galaxy to jump-start your automation project with great content from the Ansible community. Galaxy provides pre-packaged units of work such as :ref:`roles <ansible:playbooks_reuse_roles>`, and new in Galaxy 3.2, :ref:`collections <ansible:collections>`.
You can find roles for provisioning infrastructure, deploying applications, and all of the tasks you do everyday. The collection format provides a comprehensive package of automation that may include multiple playbooks, roles, modules, and plugins.
