Use Galaxy to jump-start your automation project with great content from the Ansible community. Galaxy provides pre-packaged units of work such as :ref:`roles <ansible:playbooks_reuse_roles>`, and new in Galaxy 3.2, :ref:`collections <ansible:collections>`.
You can create roles for provisioning infrastructure, deploying applications, and all of the tasks you do everyday. Taking this a step further, you can create collections which provide a comprehensive package of automation that may include multiple playbooks, roles, modules, and plugins.
