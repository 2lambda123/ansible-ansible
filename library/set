module: set
short_description: Set local variables (for this play)
description:
     - This module sets one or more local variables (scope of the play).
     - In comparison to playbook variables, using the C(set) module can
       create variables using conditions, but these variables are only
       set for the local scope (the play itself).
     - If you would like to create global variables (host facts) you can
       use the C(global) module.
options:
  key_value:
    description:
      - The C(set) module takes key=value pairs as variables to set in the
        local (play) scope. Or alternatively, accepts complex arguments using the
        C(args:) statement.
    required: true
    default: null
version_added: "1.2"
examples:
    - description: "Example setting local variables using key=value pairs"
      code: |
            action: set var1="something" var2="${password}"'
    - description: "Example setting local variables using complex arguments"
      code: |
            action: set
            args:
              var1: something
