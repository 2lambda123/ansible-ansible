module: cisco 
short_description: Templates a cisco device configuration file and passes it on to cisco transport for execution.
description:
    - This module along with the cisco tranport plugin allows users/network_admins to configure
      cisco devices via ansible, The implementation logic is quite straight forward, Network users/admins 
      can create template files for thier usual network configurations and instruct the module to execute
      those configurations in all or certain subset of thier network infrastructure. The template file
      is parsed by jinja and any variable substituations are carried out. This module has been tested on
      Cisco IOS as well as NX-OS.   
    - The cisco transport plugin supports telnet and ssh as means to communicating with the device, It also 
      supports enabling preveilege mode transition(enable) on the target devices. Transport type can be set
      at individual device level, so if a device uses telnet instead of ssh while making the entry for the device in inventory
      add a variable similar to the follwing "<device name> cisco_tranport=telnet", and plugin would use
      telnet as the transport.          

options:
  src:
    description:
      - Path of a Jinja2 formatted cisco configuration template on the local server. This can be a relative or absolute path.
    required: true
    default: null
    aliases: []
  enable:
    description:
      - Tells Ansible that while running this task privileged access is required, so ansible switches to elevated acess mode 
        The password to the "enable" command can also be provided in hostvars/group_vars/task_vars via "cisco_enable_pass=<pass>".
    required: false
    choices: [ "yes", "no" ]
    default: "no"
  enable_pass:
    description:
      - The password for the enable command
    required: false
    choices: [ "yes", "no" ]
    default: "no"
  commit:
    description:
      - This would save the configurations changes made to the startup config with the filename specified. In cisco terminology
        this issues the "copy startup config command". This paramter is only applicable for IOS, In nexus the user 
        can directly add the command to the template.
    required: false
    default: "startup-config"

notes:
  - While running this module make sure the transport type is cisco in the task or playbook.
  - If ssh is the cisco_transport make sure ansible.cfg has options compatible with cisco devices. 

requirements: [telnet binary if telnet would be used]
