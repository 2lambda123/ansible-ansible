module: fetch
short_description: Fetches a file from remote nodes
description:
     - This module works like M(copy), but in reverse. It is used for fetching
       files from remote machines and storing them locally in a file tree,
       organized by hostname. Note that this module is written to transfer 
       log files that might not be present, so a missing remote file won't
       be an error unless fail_on_missing is set to 'yes'.
version_added: "0.2"
options:
  src:
    description:
      - The file on the remote system to fetch. This I(must) be a file, not a
        directory. Recursive fetching may be supported in a later release.
    required: true
    default: null
    aliases: []
  dest:
    description:
      - A directory to save the file into. For example, if the I(dest)
        directory is C(/backup) a I(src) file named C(/etc/profile) on host
        C(host.example.com), would be saved into
        C(/backup/host.example.com/etc/profile)
    required: true
    default: null
  fail_on_missing:
    version_added: "1.1"
    description:
      - Makes it fails when the source file is missing.
    required: false
    choices: [ "yes", "no" ]
    default: "no"
  dest_prefix:
    description:
      - Defines the destination path. For dest example above, if the 
        I(dest_prefix) is C(host), the file would be saved in 
        C(/backup/host.example.com/profile). If the I(dest_prefix) is 
        C(simple), the file would be saved in C(/backup/profile).
    required: false
    choices: [ "host_source_path", "host", "simple" ]
    default: host_source_path
examples:
   - code: "fetch: src=/var/log/messages dest=/home/logtree"
