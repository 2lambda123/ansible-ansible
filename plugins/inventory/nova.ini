# API calls to OpenStack are slow. For this reason, we cache the results of an
# API call. Set this to the path you want cache files to be written to. One
# file will be written to this directory:
#   - ansible-nova.cache
cache_path = ~/.ansible/tmp

# The number of seconds a cache file is considered valid. After this many
# seconds, a new API call will be made, and the cache file will be updated.
# To disable the cache, set this value to 0
cache_max_age = 300

# This file can contain multiple sections if you have multiple clouds. Each
# section will be read and will represent a cloud.
