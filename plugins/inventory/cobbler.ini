# API calls to Cobbler can be slow. For this reason, we cache the results of an API
# call. Set this to the path you want cache files to be written to. Two files
# will be written to this directory:
#   - ansible-cobbler.cache
#   - ansible-cobbler.index

# We need to support the ability to filter results from cobbler so inventory
# can be isolated per environment. For example, if we want staging (acceptance)
# and production we should only return nodes that have their status attribute
# set respectively. The filter_status is set to production by default.
#
# filter_status = production

# The number of seconds a cache file is considered valid. After this many
# seconds, a new API call will be made, and the cache file will be updated.
