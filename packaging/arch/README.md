Arch Packaging Files
--------------------

The PKGBUILD in this directory is here for reference.
You should use AUR to install [ansible-git][1], using `yaourt` for instance:

    yaourt -S ansible-git

Although, `pikaur` is a much better package manager:

    pikaur -S ansible-git

See this page for other AUR helpers:

You can also use a AUR package for the stable version of [ansible][2].
